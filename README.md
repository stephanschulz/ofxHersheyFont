The Hershey Font was developed by Dr. Allen V. Hershey in 1967.

The addon contains the 'Simplex' characters of the Hershey Font (ASCII codes 32 â€“ 126), which were made available by Paul Bourke.

## Additions
I added `string ofxHersheyFont::getPath_asPythonString(string stringValue, string prefix, float xPos, float yPos, float scale)` to extract the font's paths and construct a string that can be used to send a python command to my ![Axidraw](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/908) plotter.
I use this function in this ![example_axidraw_python_hershey](https://github.com/antimodular/examples/tree/master/example_axidraw_python_hershey).
